# A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows the same rules 
# used in gitignore files.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These users will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# these users will be requested for review when someone opens 
# a pull request.
*       @organization/approvers

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies Powershell files, only @powershell-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.ps1    @organization/powershell-owners

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
*.backup git-approvers@organization.com

# In this example, @organization/approvers own any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @organization/approvers

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/SECURITY.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  @organization/documentation-owners

# In this example, @organization/approvers own any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @organization/approvers

# In this example, a user @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository.
/docs/ @doctocat
